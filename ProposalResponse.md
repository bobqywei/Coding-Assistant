# Group 27 - Voice Assistant

## Tentative Rating
Really hard if you are doing the voice recognition yourself. Average if you are just forwarding requests for a online service that does the processing (not your own).

## Comments
 - how will you convert speech to text?
 - what will the Google search return? First sentence of first result? Or something else? 
 - how will you retrieve what you want from the Google search?
 - will it be robust enough to take a variety of input?
